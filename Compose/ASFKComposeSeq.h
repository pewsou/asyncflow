 @brief Composition with sequential flavor.
 The main purpose: guarantee sequential execution of number of blocks upon the given data item.
 For sequence of blocks next block will start strictly after the previous block ended execution.
 More formal description: being provided with set of functions F0...Fn, this object invokes them as Fn(Fn-1(...(F0(param))...).
  When more than 1 data item supplied then all items will be composed sequentially, i.e. Fn(Fn-1(...(F0(param1))...) follwed by Fn(Fn-1(...(F0(param_2))...) ... followed by  Fn(Fn-1(...(F0(param_m))...).
  When all executions ended the summary functions will be called
