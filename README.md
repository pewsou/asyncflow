# Flow
This is an attempt to build Objective-C framework for asynchronous (concurrent) execution flow. 
It should include basic operations if-then-else, loops, composition and more above user-defined actions, which, in turn, may be synchronous or asynchronous.

The motivation is to provide robust toolkit with which one could design (concurrent) execution flow without caring too much about concurrency-related issues.
