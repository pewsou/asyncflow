 @brief maps a given daat set to another data set.
 The main purpose: provide sequential mapping of of given data set into another.
 More formal description: being provided with function F and data set D0...Dn, this object invokes them as F(D0)->D`0 ... F(Dn)->D`n and the result is in D`n.
 The order of executions is defined such that any next mapping takes place strictly after the prevoius mapping has ended.
 When all executions ended then summary procedure is invoked.
